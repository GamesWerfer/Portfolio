            <p>
                I am currently undergoing my 5th semester in BINUS University. In my spare time, I love thinking about game ideas, sketching up those game ideas, design games, and learn more about the Unity Engine. Other than Game development, I love to get myself into programming languages. I am proficient in web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. I hope I can find work in Japan one day and obtain professional experience in the Game Industry. My dream is to make my game ideas come true, build a game studio, and create a powerful and open-source game engine. As of now, I am working on a personal game project and I am studying the Japanese language (currently at JLPT N5).

                        I have just started designing a game of my own since May 2020. 
                        You can find the Game Design Document in my github under the <a href="https://github.com/GamesWerfer/Game-Design-Documents">Game-Design-Documents</a> repository.

                        I have plenty of experience in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. One of my notable works is the purchase page for my Human & Computer Interaction lab project during my 4th Semester. You can find the page in my github under the <a href="https://github.com/GamesWerfer/HCIProject-PurchasePage">HCIProject-PurchasePage</a> repository.
