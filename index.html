            <p>
                I am currently undergoing my 5th semester in BINUS University. In my spare time, I love thinking about game ideas, sketching up those game ideas, design games, and learn more about the Unity Engine. Other than Game development, I love to get myself into programming languages. I am proficient in web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. I hope I can find work in Japan one day and obtain professional experience in the Game Industry. My dream is to make my game ideas come true, build a game studio, and create a powerful and open-source game engine. As of now, I am working on a personal game project and I am studying the Japanese language (currently at JLPT N5).

                        I have just started designing a game of my own since May 2020. This game will put the player in a position of various cooks in different restaurants, and the player is tasked with cooking and serving the unique dishes of each restaurant. For more details, you  can find the Game Design Document in my github under the <a class="hyperlinkType2" href="https://github.com/GamesWerfer/Game-Design-Documents">Game-Design-Documents</a> repository.

                        Since 2018, I have learned how to make several types of games using Unity3D and C# Scripting using YouTube tutorials. Among these games, my greatest achievement was when I learned how to make an FPS game. Here, I learned how to implement a mouse-controlled camera system, a hitbox detection system, and particle effects. Currently, I am attempting to create a game based on my own idea (as mentioned before) using all the knowledge I have obtained the past two years.

                        I have plenty of experience in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. One of my notable works is the purchase page for my Human & Computer Interaction lab project during my 4th Semester. In this page, I implemented a dynamic user interface that reacts to the userâ€™s cursor wherever it hovers. Furthermore, I implemented a prototype ticket purchase system using JavaScript which simulates the purchasing system. You can find the page in my GitHub under the <a class="hyperlinkType2" href="https://github.com/GamesWerfer/HCIProject-PurchasePage">HCIProject-PurchasePage</a> repository.
